# 7 Segment Display

This folder contains an example of using a 2x 7 Segment Display. In this particular test, the [PMOD SSD](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodssd/reference-manual) has been used.

For Vcc, 3v3 is recommended. Both are tied together, so you need to connect one to the Alhambra board 3v3.

Check the [reference manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/pmod/pmodssd/pmodssd_rm.pdf) for more info
